# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Iris Dataset

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, distributions, outliers, and relationships between features.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for Iris dataset loading)

## 📂 Dataset
Iris Dataset (built-in dataset from scikit-learn)

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. Loaded Iris dataset and created a DataFrame
2. Checked dataset shape, info, and missing values
3. Generated summary statistics using `describe()`
4. Plotted numerical feature distributions using histograms
5. Analyzed categorical feature (species) using countplot
6. Identified outliers using boxplots
7. Visualized correlations using heatmap
8. Used pairplot for deeper feature relationship understanding
9. Wrote insights and identified important features for prediction

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Dataset has no missing values
- All species are equally distributed (balanced dataset)
- Petal length and petal width are highly correlated
- Petal features are most important for prediction

## 📌 Output Files
- EDA Notebook (.ipynb)
- Visual Insights Report (.md)
